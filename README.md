# Pytest_Examples - My Own Notes 

Examples using Pytest
In windows a directory called new_pytest was created.
> mkdir new_pytest
>cd new_pytest

> py -m pip install virtualenv
> env\scripts\activate.bat
>pip install pytest

Then used NotePad++ to write the code
Saved it test_Program1

Then run pytest
pytest test_Program1
pytest .

Then installed flake8 - something which checks format
>pip install flake8#
>flake8 test_Program1

Correct the code

Then load onto github

>git add ...
> git status...
>git commit

Create a file called Requiments.txt 
which contains 
pytest
So when these files are downloaded, the user can run the pytest porgram.

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "addrequirements.txt"
